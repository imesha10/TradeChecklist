# TradeChecklist
I created this file so I can keep track of the rules I'm looking for when I'm practicing trading. I also use this for recording purpose by being able to turn the data into a string format to be pasted into Onenote or alike to keep track of decisions.


## How to use?
### Definition
Item: "A single rule"

### Buttons
"On Top" keeps the windows always on top.    
"Add/Mod" add or modifies the items. More explained in the following section.   
"Clear" cleares the items.  
"Copy" creates "Item Name: Name of Radio Button Selected" for each item and puts it in your clipboard.  
"Reset" sets all item radio button to "None".  

### Adding/Modifying Items
Have 1 rule per line.  
"Apply" adds the rules in the textbox.  
"Clear" removes the textbox content.  
"Set Default" saves the contents of the textbox in the excecutable.
